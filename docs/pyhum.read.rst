.. pyhum.read:

pyhum.read module
======================

    Read a .DAT and associated set of .SON files recorded by a Humminbird(R)
    instrument. 

    The following Humminbird units are supported:
    1) 700, 800, 900 and 1100 series
    2) ONIX series
    
    Parse the data into a set of memory mapped files that will
    subsequently be used by the other functions of the PyHum module. 
    
    Export time-series data and metadata in other formats. 
    
    Create a kml file for visualising boat track

Syntax
----------

You call the function like this::

    [] = PyHum.read(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, c, draft, doplot, t, bedpick, flip_lr, chunksize, model, calc_bearing, filt_bearing, cog, chunk)

Parameters
------------

    humfile : str
       path to the .DAT file
    sonpath : str
       path where the *.SON files are
    cs2cs_args : int, *optional* [Default="epsg:26949"]
       arguments to create coordinates in a projected coordinate system
       this argument gets given to pyproj to turn wgs84 (lat/lon) coordinates
       into any projection supported by the proj.4 libraries
    c : float, *optional* [Default=1450.0]
       speed of sound in water (m/s). Defaults to a value of freshwater
    draft : float, *optional* [Default=0.3]
       draft from water surface to transducer face (m)
    doplot : float, *optional* [Default=1]
       if 1, plots will be made
    t : float, *optional* [Default=0.108]
       length of transducer array (m).
       Default value is that of the 998 series Humminbird(R)    
    bedpick : int, *optional* [Default=1]
       if 1, bedpicking with be carried out automatically
       if 0, user will be prompted to pick the bed location on screen
    flip_lr : int, *optional* [Default=0]
       if 1, port and starboard scans will be flipped
       (for situations where the transducer is flipped 180 degrees)
    model: int, *optional* [Default=998]
       A 3 or 4 number code indicating the model number 
       Examples: 998, 997, 1198, 1199
    cog : int, *optional* [Default=1]
       if 1, heading calculated assuming GPS course-over-ground rather than
       using a compass
    calc_bearing : float, *optional* [Default=0]
       if 1, bearing will be calculated from coordinates
    filt_bearing : float, *optional* [Default=0]
       if 1, bearing will be filtered
    chunk : str, *optional* [Default='d100' (distance, 100 m)]
       letter, followed by a number.
       There are the following letter options:
       'd' - parse chunks based on distance, then number which is distance in m
       'p' - parse chunks based on number of pings, then number which is number of pings 
       'h' - parse chunks based on change in heading, then number which is the change in heading in degrees
       '1' - process just 1 chunk
